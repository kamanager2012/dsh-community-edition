# Changelog

## Unreleased

Desktop shell polish on the same GitHub repo. No new Release tag.

- Desktop settings: hide-to-tray, optional isolated official home (restarts `dsh web`)
- Official session list shows mtime and copies `dsh-community-tui --resume <id>`
- Host diagnostics page; shell nav on every chrome page
- Isolated mode now lists and launches against `userData/isolated-dsh`, not `~/.dsh`
- `dsh-community-tui` treats a leading `--` as a pnpm passthrough so `--help` / `--list-sessions` work
- Desktop keeps a chrome bar while official `dsh web` runs in a child view
- `--list-sessions` prints transcript mtime next to the official path
- TUI: human session list, `--resume last`, `--resume` picker, no-TTY hint
- Desktop session page highlights the latest chat and copies `--resume last`
- `dsh-community-tui --doctor` checks official pin / TTY / API key without printing the secret
- Desktop chrome and About say when `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` is missing

## 0.1.1-preview — 2026-08-16

Release: https://github.com/kamanager2012/dsh-community/releases/tag/v0.1.1-preview

Published only from this repository. Official `@deepseek-ai/dsh@0.1.0-rc.6` is the development foundation.

- Community TUI launcher (`dsh-community-tui`) boots official `dsh --profile dsh-community-tui`
- `--list-sessions` / `--resume <id>` read and validate official `~/.dsh/sessions`
- `--resume` is forwarded as official app args (`dsh --profile … --resume <id>`)
- Desktop Host menu lists the same official session store
- TUI patch surface stays at 8 owned rows (reference TUI bundle is 33)
- Do not npm-publish workspace packages; do not use the `dsh-tui` binary name

## 0.1.0-preview — 2026-08-15

Release: https://github.com/kamanager2012/dsh-community/releases/tag/v0.1.0-preview

First public-shaped preview. Not a replacement for official DSH, dsh-TUI, or the third-party Desktop installers.

- Thin Electron shell that spawns published `@deepseek-ai/dsh@0.1.0-rc.6` (`dsh web`)
- Official `~/.dsh` is the default session store
- Lifecycle-only IPC; stdout is diagnostics
- Contract snapshots of official CLI / config rows / session-agent-approval-plugin surfaces
- Desktop-owned Version Manager reads `latest-tested`; does not switch official artifacts yet
- TUI work is a seam + patch-surface KPI. Ink stays a mounted plugin, not a vendored fork
