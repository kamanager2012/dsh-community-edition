# Architecture

Community **distribution + compatibility** around the **currently published** official DeepSeek Harness (`@deepseek-ai/dsh`, pinned). Not a second harness, and not a client that waits for the next official app.

There is no second agent runtime in the middle.

The product is a **stable client**: launch official dsh, share `~/.dsh`, survive an rc bump. Capabilities that a DSH plugin can own (Ink chrome, context panels, compressors, voice, memory) stay plugins. This client discovers them and copies `dsh plugin add`; it does not reimplement them.

## What official currently signals

Official `apps/` today is `cli` and `web`. Architecture says UI/editor integration should drive `ctx.agents` and render from `session/event`, and that there is no privileged core to patch.

That is a strong **architecture** signal: runtime + composable surfaces, not every UI in core.

It is **not** a product declaration that official will never ship a TUI. If they do, community TUI still attaches through public seams instead of forking core.

## stdout is logs

```
Official DSH
   ├── official HTTP / WS / session/event   ← Desktop/TUI business state
   └── stdout / stderr                      ← crash / diagnostics / log viewer
```

Runtime Manager may own only what the desktop shell must know and official does not expose as a product API:

- PID, start success, port, exit code, crash, health

Do **not** parse “agent is reasoning” from stdout. Do **not** grow a Desktop Runtime Protocol (`agent/running`, `tool/start`, `session/changed`, …).

## Data directories

```
Official DSH          ~/.dsh/          sessions, credentials, profiles, plugins
Desktop-owned         app userData     runtime-versions, window-state, logs, crash-reports
```

Default: do not rewrite `DSH_HOME`. TUI, official Web, and Desktop see the same session log.

Isolated Desktop runtime is opt-in (`DSH_COMMUNITY_ISOLATED=1`, or Desktop Settings). Session list and `dsh web` then use `userData/isolated-dsh`.

## contracts/ snapshots official surface

Snapshot official exports, CLI, config rows, and packages. Do not maintain `event-types.ts` as “our DSH types”.

A new official rc: extract → diff snapshots → contract tests → then TUI/Desktop smoke. Compatibility matrix records **latest tested**, not npm latest. Desktop Version Manager reads that file and writes pins only under app userData.

## Success criteria

1. **Official Source Ownership = 0** — no vendored `packages/core`, `apps/web`, …
2. **TUI patch-surface reduction** — official Cordis row overrides go 33 → 15 → 8 → TUI-owned inserts only
3. **TUI/Desktop do not implement** Agent loop, Session persistence, Tool execution, or plugin-solvable features (diff chrome, auto-approval, context guard, extra tools)
4. **Upstream rc bump** does not require business UI code changes
5. **TUI / Desktop / official Web share the same session source of truth**
6. **Breaks fail in contract CI first**, not on a user’s machine
